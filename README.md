I have independently implemented all the data structures that were covered in the data structure course. 
This repository includes basic implementations of various data structures in C++. 
The data structures featured are:
Simple Arrays
Circular Array
Linked List
Circular Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Doubly Linked List
Stack
LIFO Queue
FIFO Queue
Heap
AVL Tree
Hash Table
Binary Search Tree
Graph
All data structures are managed using pointers, except for the Simple Array. Some of the data structures are presented with multiple variations.
